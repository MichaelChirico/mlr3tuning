\title{Abstract Terminator Class}
\format{\link[R6:R6Class]{R6::R6Class} object.}
\description{
Abstract \code{Terminator} class that implements the main functionality each terminator must have.
A terminator is an object that determines when to stop the tuning.

Termination of tuning works as follows:
\itemize{
\item Evaluations in a tuner a performed in batches of size \code{batch_size}.
\item After a batch-eval the Tuner is checked, if it is positive, we stop.
\item The tuning algorithm itself might decide not to produce any more points or even a smaller batch in its last evaluation.
}

Therefore the following note seems in order: While it is definitely possible to execute a fine-grained control for termination,
and for many tuners we can specify exactly when to stop, it might happen that a few too many or even a few too few evaluations are
performed, especially if your batchsize is large. So better check the size of the returned archive.
